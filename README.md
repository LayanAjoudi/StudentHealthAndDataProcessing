# Student Health & Data Processing 🩺📊

A Data Engineering project focused on analyzing student health data using different stages of data processing, from structured storage to real-time filtering and interactive visualization.

## 🔧 Technologies Used
- **SQLite (SQL)** – for relational database design and queries  
- **TinyDB (NoSQL)** – for flexible JSON-based data modeling  
- **PySpark** – for stream processing simulation  
- **Streamlit** – for building an interactive dashboard  
- **Google Colab** – for project demo and collaboration  

## 📁 Project Phases

### 1. Relational Database (SQL)
- Created normalized schema for student health, lifestyle, and stress data
- Performed CRUD operations and optimized queries

### 2. NoSQL Database (TinyDB)
- Transformed part of the data into JSON format
- Ran NoSQL queries for insights such as risk levels

### 3. Stream Processing (PySpark)
- Simulated real-time filtering for high blood pressure, stress, and study overload

### 4. Dashboard (Streamlit)
- Unified insights from all phases into one interactive interface

## 📊 Sample Use Cases
- Find students with poor sleep or high stress
- Monitor those at risk due to study load or health metrics
- Visualize patterns in lifestyle and academic effort
